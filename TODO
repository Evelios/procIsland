th- ere are some artifacts on the edge of the map and in flat areas.

- There is one problem where rivers are placed differently because the river start location is determined

- There are some some issues with rendering where the screen shows black or the screen is half rendered.

- There might be a map renering or creation error when going aboce a certain number of points. This could be caused
by the
